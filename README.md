# CSGO-SmartCross
A project that adds a rich suite of features to the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive crosshair.
Without maintaining a handle to the game process, SmartCross provides:
* Custom image crosshair
* Recoil-tracking crosshair
* Automatic recoil control system (RCS)
* Automatic rapid-fire
* Automatic shoot-on-sight (triggerbot)
* Bunnyhop assist

Because SmartCross doesn't access any memory outside of its own address space (or even open a handle to csgo.exe)
and contains no recycled code, there's no reason to believe that it could be flagged by the Valve Anti-Cheat system (VAC)
or cause an in-game ban.
